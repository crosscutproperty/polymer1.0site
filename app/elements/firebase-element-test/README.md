# polymerAndFirebaseProj
A sandbox for functionality I will be using on another project - 
this project aims to provide a secure solution to firebase data 
storage from clientside to ensure security and crossbranch integrity 
with out a private server as an intermediary


Special Instructions:

1. Clone this project then

2. cd into your bower_components directory

3. mkdir firebase-element cd into it

4. Clone fromSpace/firebase-element to current directory

5. Copy the contents of firebase.rules to your firebase security section

6. Update the firebase URL in main.js to reflect your DB

Rational:

The entirety of firebase-element is not in bower
also a simple correction was necassary to make it work

This is an initial start to using a custom element as well as 
staging specific functionality for a firebase application
